# Hi, I'm Mike Baxter!

I'm a consultant and trainer for Econsultancy.com.  
I'm designing, developing and running a brand new course on 'coding for beginners' targeted at 'digital professionals'(non-technical business professionals who manage web sites or web teams)
... and I'm developing the assets AND delivering the course entirely on Codio
